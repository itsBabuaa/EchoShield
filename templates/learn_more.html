    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="learn-section">
        <h2>What Are Deepfakes?</h2>
        <p>Deepfakes are synthetic media created using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques. The term combines "deep learning" and "fake" to describe content that has been manipulated or entirely generated by AI to appear authentic.</p>
        <p>While deepfakes can be used for entertainment and creative purposes, they pose significant risks when used maliciously to deceive, defraud, or manipulate public opinion.</p>

        <h2>How Deepfake Audio Works</h2>
        <div class="tech-grid">
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
                <p>AI systems analyze hours of real audio recordings to learn voice patterns, intonation, accent, and speech characteristics of the target person.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>2. Model Training</h3>
                <p>Neural networks, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders, are trained to replicate the voice patterns with high accuracy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>3. Voice Synthesis</h3>
                <p>The trained model can generate new speech in the target's voice, saying words or sentences they never actually spoke.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tech-card">
                <h3>4. Refinement</h3>
                <p>Advanced techniques add natural imperfections, breathing sounds, and emotional nuances to make the fake audio more convincing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- Real-World Cases -->
    <section class="learn-section">
        <h2>Real-World Cases</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>🏢 Corporate Fraud (2019)</h3>
            <p>A UK-based energy company CEO received a call from who he thought was his boss, the CEO of the parent company. The voice was a deepfake, and the fraudsters successfully stole $243,000.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>🗳️ Political Manipulation (2020)</h3>
            <p>Deepfake audio of political figures has been used to spread misinformation during elections, creating false statements that went viral before fact-checkers could respond.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>💰 Banking Fraud (2021)</h3>
            <p>Criminals used deepfake voice technology to bypass voice authentication systems at multiple banks, gaining unauthorized access to customer accounts.</p>
